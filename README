This project is incomplete. It is an attempt at turning Slime's presentations into something similar to Smalltalk's halos. It is a proof of concepts, just a test. Please send your bug reports and other patches, thanks!

TODOs

* Can't figure how to load this contrib thing. Putting it into my (slime-setup '(slime-fancy slime-indentation slime-halos)) fails. For now, leave it out, and load swank-halos.lisp then slime-halos.el manually.

* Halos don't work in the REPL anymore.

* Personal TODO - set up keybinding once auto setup works

(define-key slime-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'slime-eval-present-last-expression)
(add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (interactive) (define-key slime-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'slime-eval-present-last-expression)))


* Remove the patch to slime-menu-choices-for-presentation perhaps by
adding menu options to the Lisp side only? Will this cost us a new RPC
message?

* Remove other dirty patches:

present-repl-results
dispatch-event
